          So, check this out, peeps! Digital literacy in Indo is like 62%,
          lagging behind our ASEAN pals. We gotta up our game, you feel me?
          Gov's like, "We need 50k digital wizards monthly!" But guess what?
          We're just churning out 100k-200k a year. Big gap, right? Now,
          internet use is high â€“ 210 million users! But here's the plot twist:
          kiddos are the real MVPs, with 62.43% (ages 5-12) and a whopping
          99.16% (ages 13-18) using the web. We did a survey, and guess what?
          77% of these cool cats are into coding. But, hold up! They're facing
          roadblocks like no coding lessons, language barriers, and the struggle
          to find good resources. Enter Coddie, our superhero app! With
          game-like coding lessons, we're leveling up digital literacy for the
          young guns. Woro Srihastuti Sulistyaningrum from Kemenko PMK is vibing
          with us, saying we need a special digital literacy plan for these
          young internet explorers. Together, we're building a solid foundation
          for the future tech champs! Coddie: Teaching Code, Playing Smart â€“ our
          move to boost Indo's digital game

        <p className="text-[18px]  text-justify   ">
          Alright, let's craft it in English with that laid-back vibe: The snag
          we're tackling? Digital literacy in Indo is only at 62%, way below our
          ASEAN buddies. The gov shouts, "We need 50k digital talents monthly!"
          But reality check, we're churning out only 100k-200k annually. That's
          a massive gap, ain't it? Now, the internet users in Indo are a
          whopping 210 million, and the real fire comes from the kiddos. It's
          62.43% for the age group 5-12 and a mind-blowing 99.16% for 13-18. Did
          a survey, and guess what? 77% of them want to code. But here's the
          hitch, bro! Coding classes are almost non-existent, English is a
          struggle, and finding good learning resources? Tough luck.

          To understand the needs and pain points of users, we conduct user
          research using the Design Thinking method. The design thinking method
          has proven to be effective in understanding the wishes of the user, as
          evidenced by the results of research from the University of Virginia.
          To further maximize user research, we use 3 different approaches.
